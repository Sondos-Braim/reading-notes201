## Problem Domain
Being a programmer is not only about writing the code. It is much wider than just that. One of the common problems that programmers have when they have a project is that they start writing the code without even understanding what the problem domain is. You should always make sure that you know how exactly your employer wants with this website and how exactly it should work. Writing the code while you understand it from the first time is way easier than spending more time on editing and changing it after you know more about it. You should resist the thought of starting with the actual writing because you don’t want to waste your time talking about it. But you should know that it’s going to save you time rather than wasting it.
## Objects
Every object has its own properties and methods. The variables are the properties to the object and the functions are the methods.
You can use the method to know the property of the object. In order to get the property for the object you should use the dot notation between the object name and the method.
## DOM
The DOM refers to the Document Object Model.

In every browser, it has a tree that has all the elements and nodes required to create a page. JavaScript has access to this tree and it is allowed to make changes on it.

You can add, delete, and change elements from the HTML page in the JavaScript file using the Dom.

You can use the id and give it to any element in the HTML to specify the location of it in order to be able to manipulate it.

By the id:

 `getElementByld( ‘ id ‘ )`
 
By the class:

`getEl ementsByClassName( ‘ class ‘ )`

By the tag name:

`getEl ementsByTagName( ‘ tagName ‘ )`

You can select an element by the NodeList using the item() method and the array method but the array method is preferred because it is faster and easier and you can name the nodeList into a variable if you are going to use it too often. You can also use the for loop and the if statement which can make it even easier.

There is something called traversing the element which is selecting the element according to its relationship with other elements.

`parentNode`

`previousSibling` 

`nextSibling`

`firstChild`

 `lastChild`
 
If you are curious about how the Dom tree looks like, browsers have the tools to make developers view it.
