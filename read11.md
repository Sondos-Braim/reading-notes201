## CSS Images, SEO

-	You can control the width and height of the images on your website using the length and width properties. If you are going to use images with the same sizes throughout your pages, you can name each size and then just specify it by the name.

-	There are many ways in which you can control the place of the image on a webpage and the most traditional one is the float property that makes the image move to the right or left of its container. You can also use the image align attribute than you use as a class to align the image.

-	You can align images to be centered by converting them into block elements. You can also make the right and left margins into auto or image align center or text align center to the containing element.

-	You can add background images to your web pages by the property background-img and then the url, the image will repeat by default if it’s smaller than the apace of the element.

-	Background images can be repeated vertically or horizontally or not repeated at all.

-	You can also position the background images if they’re not repeated by specifying two values of where the image should be placed, you can also use percentages and pixels.

-	There is a shortcut for writing the properties that are related to the background which is by writing the values after the property background and you can omit any value that you don’t need.

-	You can use gradients as a background by choosing two colors.

-	Remember to always have a low contrast when applying a background to a text so that the text will be readable.

-	You can use image sprites if you are using the same image more than one time because it will make the website load faster.
