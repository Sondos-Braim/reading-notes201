### CSS

Each HTML element is considered to be a box so each element had a property of block level or inline block and this affects how it is displayed on the page. So when it is a block element it takes the whole line and no element can be on the same line. But when it’s an inline element it is going to take the spacer of its content only. You should be familiar with the word containing element which is the parent of each element.

 Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed **positioning**. If it is absolute position, it will move to the side and size that you specified in the code but in relation to the containing element. If it’s relative it will move in relation to its original place. And if it is fixed, then it doesn’t change its place no matter how far you scroll down.
 
 **The float property** moves content to the left or right of the page but you should give it a width first. It is the perfect property when you want to place elements beside each other. But now programmers do not use it as often.
When you do not want your element to touch the sides of a container element, then you can use the clear property.
There are some problems that may occur to the parent when it contains a floated child and that happens in some browsers that’s why you need to set a width of 100% to the parent and an auto overflow.
 You can also make your website responsive to other sizes of screens so that it would be easier to reach all kinds of audience. Screens also have different resolutions so you should keep this in mind when designing a professional website.
  Pages can be fixed width which means that it cannot change the size when the widow is big or small. Or liquid *layouts* that use percentages to specify the width of screens so that it increases according to the screen size.
  
 **Grids** help create professional and flexible designs as it allows the user to align the page and create columns and rows. It is a very helpful way to structure the page.
 
 **CSS Frameworks** provide rules for common tasks and they contain grids which makes easier and more friendly webpages. They are codes that are already written and you just include them into your file instead of having to do it from scratch.
 
  You can include multiple CSS files in one page but you need to know which when you want to apply first.
