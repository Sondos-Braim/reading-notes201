## Model domain
Whenever you face a problem in coding, what you need to do is domain model which is having a clear concept of the problem that you have before even starting to think of a solution. So when you are building something that has the same instances, you can build them in an object but make sure that you include a constructor function that will make sure that they are organized. Start by trying to make it handle one job at a time. To make your work flow according to plan, make sure to use the `new` keyword and `this` keyword.
## Tables
Tables make your work so much neater and it makes access to the information easier. and it makes access to the information easier. You can create a table using html tags such as `table`,`td`, `tr` and `th`.you can also design your table using css.
One flexible thing that you can do id spanning columns if you want more space in a certain place. With rows or columns. Some tables are very long that you need to divide them into head, body, and foot.
## Objects
When you are dealing with more than one object, you can use a function to store them. You should be familiar with `new` keyword that should be used in every constructor function. We also use the keyword `this` that refers to the object that the fuction operates.
Both arrays and objects are ways of storing different data. If you want to store data according to its property you can use to object but if the order is important, use an array
Arrays are kind of objects that actually have a key and a value but the key in arrays are the index.
You can combine objects and arrays and do nested objects and combine everything together to find the perfect way to store your data. 
The object has three types, browser object model because the whole screen on the browser is an object in itself. DOM, document object model that has the tree of html and can be accessed by javaScript to edit it. 
And finally, the global JavaScipt objects which are defined and you can use them in specific ways. Some global objects are used to do calculations or to do something with the data. For example, we have math objects that we can use at any time.
We might need to have a random number that will change every time you refresh your website and this is actually done using one of the math objects with is random.
